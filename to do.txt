- make on/off switches save in settings:

Call these three lines when the switch is turned on/off
    DeviceTimeSeriesData newDataPoint = deviceData.getDeviceSettings(widget.deviceTitle);
    newDataPoint.heartRateEmissionsOn = isHeartRateEmissionEnabled;
    deviceData.addDataPoint(widget.deviceTitle, newDataPoint);



- different emission time for hr-triggered emission vs button press
- different cooldown time for a heartrate triggered emission
- rate settings at end of day (satified-dissatisfied)
- notes from caretaker/teacher
- way to look at past settings
