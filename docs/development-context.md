## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Required Permissions
[Previous permissions section remains the same]

### Core Data Types
```dart
// lib/core/models/device.dart
class Device extends ChangeNotifier with EquatableMixin {
  final String id;
  final String deviceName;
  String connectedQueName;
  BluetoothDevice? bluetoothDevice;
  static const Duration defaultEmissionDuration = Duration(seconds: 10);

  // Private fields for state management
  Duration _emission1Duration;
  Duration _emission2Duration;
  Duration _releaseInterval1;
  Duration _releaseInterval2;
  bool _isPeriodicEmissionEnabled;
  bool _isPeriodicEmissionEnabled2;
  bool _isBleConnected;
  int _heartrateThreshold;
  final BleService bleService;
  final Map<String, List<String>> bluetoothServiceCharacteristics;

  // Getters and setters implementation
  Duration get emission1Duration => _emission1Duration;
  Duration get emission2Duration => _emission2Duration;
  Duration get releaseInterval1 => _releaseInterval1;
  Duration get releaseInterval2 => _releaseInterval2;
  bool get isPeriodicEmissionEnabled => _isPeriodicEmissionEnabled;
  bool get isPeriodicEmissionEnabled2 => _isPeriodicEmissionEnabled2;
  bool get isBleConnected => _isBleConnected;
  int get heartrateThreshold => _heartrateThreshold;

  set isBleConnected(bool value) {
    _isBleConnected = value;
    notifyListeners();
  }

  // Constructor and factory implementation
  // Update methods implementation
  // copyWith method implementation
  // State management methods
  // BLE connection handling
  // Device deletion
  // JSON serialization
}

// lib/features/device_settings/models/settings_config.dart
[Previous SettingsConfig implementation remains the same]

// lib/core/models/note.dart
[Previous Note implementation remains the same]
```
