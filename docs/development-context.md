# Que App: Development Context and Documentation
[Last Updated: 2024-11-27]

## Purpose
This document provides essential context and current development status to assist with the ongoing development of the Que App, a Flutter application for managing BLE-enabled scent devices. This document should be used alongside the project structure document to understand both the current state and implementation details.

## Development Instructions for LLM Assistant
- Always include the complete file directory at the top of code files
- Provide the complete code file when possible
- The information provided in this document should be aimed at facilitating easy understanding of the project by the LLM.


## Current Development State

### Active Development
- **Current Task**: Database service provider implementation and provider tree optimization
- **Last Major Change**: Implemented singleton database service provider and standardized access patterns (2024-11-27)
- **Next Priority**: HIPAA-compliant storage implementation and dialog parameter standardization

### Implementation Status
#### Core Services Status
- ✓ BLE Connection Management
- ✓ Device State Management
- ✓ BLE Constants and UUIDs
- ✓ Database Service Architecture
- 🔄 Database Implementation
- 📋 Analytics Service
- 📋 Logging Service
- 📋 Encryption Service

#### Feature Implementation Status
- ✓ Device Settings Architecture
- ✓ Settings UI Components
- ✓ BLE Permissions
- ✓ Device Control Feature
- ✓ Device Info Dialog
- ✓ Heart Rate Configuration UI
- 🔄 Notes Feature
- 🔄 Global Navigation

### Critical Implementation Gaps
1. Database Service
- ✓ Core database architecture implemented as singleton
- ✓ Basic CRUD operations structure defined
- 🔄 HIPAA compliance implementation in progress
- Migration to feature-specific repositories needed
- Local storage encryption required
- Secure heart rate data storage needed

2. Dialog Parameter Standardization
- ✓ Duration selection dialog parameters standardized
- ✓ Heart rate threshold dialog parameters aligned
- ✓ Device info dialog implementation completed
- Remaining dialog implementations need review

3. Testing Strategy
- BLoC tests needed for implemented features
- UI component testing framework needed
- E2E testing strategy required
- Security testing plan needed

### Architecture Notes
1. State Management
- Using BLoC pattern for feature-level state
- ChangeNotifier for model-level state
- Equatable for state comparison
- Provider pattern for service injection

2. BLE Implementation
- Singleton service pattern
- Modern FlutterBluePlus API usage
- Persistent connection management
- Standardized BLE constants implementation
- Timeout handling implemented

3. Feature Organization
- Feature-first architecture
- Shared core services
- Feature-specific repositories
- Secure data handling patterns
- Proper dependency injection via provider

### Required Fixes
1. ⚠️ High Priority
- HIPAA-compliant storage implementation
- Secure heart rate data handling
- Database service provider access standardization
- Provider tree optimization

2. 🔄 In Progress
- Feature-first architecture migration
- Global state management
- Navigation system
- Dialog parameters alignment
- Database service implementation

3. 📋 Planned
- Analytics integration
- Logging system
- Comprehensive testing
- Security audit implementation
